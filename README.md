# word_guessing_game
The Word Guessing Game using C++ is a console-based interactive application designed to strengthen programming fundamentals.
The project challenges players to guess a randomly selected word by entering one letter at a time. It demonstrates essential programming constructs such as loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and randomization.
The goal is to create an engaging learning experience that enhances logic-building and user interaction in C++.
Games are an excellent way to learn programming concepts practically.
This project implements a simple word guessing game that provides players with feedback based on their guesses. Each correct letter is revealed in the hidden word, while incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining attempts.
Through this project, students can understand how to manage game logic, process user input, and provide interactive feedbackâ€”all within a console-based environment using C++.
